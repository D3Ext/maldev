# Introduction

`maldev` aims to help malware developers, red teamers, cybersecurity enthusiasts or simply Golang developers. Most of the available features are not too hard to implement, but it is simply better to have multiple functions with just importing one package. This project is not finished yet but the official API is mostly stable. Anyway if you find a bug feel free to open an issue or create a pull-request which fixes it.

# Installation

Just execute this and it should be installed without problems:

```sh
go get -u https://github.com/D3Ext/maldev
```

# Usage

To import all the functions at the same time do it like this:

```go
import (
    maldev "github.com/D3Ext/maldev/all"
)
```

Anyway if you want to use functions from an especific topic, you can do so like this:

> Example with cryptography
```go
import (
    "github.com/D3Ext/maldev/src/crypto"
)
```

# Examples

In every directory there is a **README.md** which contains at least one example of every defined function. You may also want to take a look at the [examples/](https://github.com/D3Ext/maldev/tree/main/examples) directory where you can find simple tools that use ***maldev***.
